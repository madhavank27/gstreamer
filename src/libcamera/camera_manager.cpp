/**
 * \class CameraManager
 * \brief Provide access and manage all cameras in the system
 *
 * The camera manager is the entry point to libcamera. It enumerates devices,
 * associates them with pipeline managers, and provides access to the cameras
 * in the system to applications. The manager owns all Camera objects and
 * handles hot-plugging and hot-unplugging to manage the lifetime of cameras.
 *
 * To interact with libcamera, an application starts by creating a camera
 * manager instance. Only a single instance of the camera manager may exist at
 * a time. Attempting to create a second instance without first deleting the
 * existing instance results in undefined behaviour.
 *
 * The manager is initially stopped, and shall be configured before being
 * started. In particular a custom event dispatcher shall be installed if
 * needed with CameraManager::setEventDispatcher().
 *
 * Once the camera manager is configured, it shall be started with start().
 * This will enumerate all the cameras present in the system, which can then be
 * listed with list() and retrieved with get().
 *
 * Cameras are shared through std::shared_ptr<>, ensuring that a camera will
 * stay valid until the last reference is released without requiring any special
 * action from the application. Once the application has released all the
 * references it held to cameras, the camera manager can be stopped with
 * stop().
 *
 * \todo Add interface to register a notification callback to the user to be
 * able to inform it new cameras have been hot-plugged or cameras have been
 * removed due to hot-unplug.
