/**
 * \page thread Thread Support
 *
 * libcamera supports multi-threaded applications through a threading model that
 * sets precise rules to guarantee thread-safe usage of the API. Additionally,
 * libcamera makes internal use of threads, and offers APIs that simplify
 * interactions with application threads. Careful compliance with the threading
 * model will ensure avoidance of race conditions.
 *
 * \section thread-objects Threads and Objects
 *
 * Instances of the Object class and all its derived classes are thread-aware
 * and are bound to the thread they are created in. They are said to *live* in
 * a thread, and they interact with the event loop of their thread for the
 * purpose of message passing and signal delivery. Messages posted to the
 * object with Object::postMessage() will be delivered from the event loop of
 * the thread that the object lives in. Signals delivered to the object, unless
 * explicitly connected with ConnectionTypeDirect, will also be delivered from
 * the object thread's event loop.
 *
 * All Object instances created by libcamera are bound to an internal thread,
 * and applications don't need to provide an event loop to support them. Object
 * instances created by applications require an event loop. It is the
 * responsibility of applications to provide that event loop, either explicitly
 * through CameraManager::setEventDispatcher(), or by running the default event
 * loop provided by CameraManager::eventDispatcher() in their main thread. The
 * main thread of an application is the one that calls CameraManager::start().
 *
 * \section thread-signals Threads and Signals
 *
 * When sent to a receiver that does not inherit from the Object class, signals
 * are delivered synchronously in the thread of the sender. When the receiver
 * inherits from the Object class, delivery is by default asynchronous if the
 * sender and receiver live in different threads. In that case, the signal is
 * posted to the receiver's message queue and will be delivered from the
 * receiver's event loop, running in the receiver's thread. This mechanism can
 * be overridden by selecting a different connection type when calling
 * Signal::connect().
 *
 * Asynchronous signal delivery is used internally in libcamera, but is also
 * available to applications if desired. To use this feature, applications
 * shall create receiver classes that inherit from the Object class, and
 * provide an event loop to the CameraManager as explained above. Note that
 * Object instances created by the application are limited to living in the
 * application's main thread. Creating Object instances from another thread of
 * an application causes undefined behaviour.
 *
 * \section thread-reentrancy Reentrancy and Thread-Safety
 *
 * Through the documentation, several terms are used to define how classes and
 * their member functions can be used from multiple threads.
 *
 * - A **reentrant** function may be called simultaneously from multiple
 *   threads if and only if each invocation uses a different instance of the
 *   class. This is the default for all member functions not explictly marked
 *   otherwise.
 *
 * - \anchor thread-safe A **thread-safe** function may be called
 *   simultaneously from multiple threads on the same instance of a class. A
 *   thread-safe function is thus reentrant. Thread-safe functions may also be
 *   called simultaneously with any other reentrant function of the same class
 *   on the same instance.
 *
 * - \anchor thread-bound A **thread-bound** function may be called only from
 *   the thread that the class instances lives in (see section \ref
 *   thread-objects). For instances of classes that do not derive from the
 *   Object class, this is the thread in which the instance was created. A
 *   thread-bound function is not thread-safe, and may or may not be reentrant.
 *
 * Neither reentrancy nor thread-safety, in this context, mean that a function
 * may be called simultaneously from the same thread, for instance from a
 * callback invoked by the function. This may deadlock and isn't allowed unless
 * separately documented.
 *
 * A class is defined as reentrant, thread-safe or thread-bound if all its
 * member functions are reentrant, thread-safe or thread-bound respectively.
 * Some member functions may additionally be documented as having additional
 * thread-related attributes.
 *
 * Most classes are reentrant but not thread-safe, as making them fully
 * thread-safe would incur locking costs considered prohibitive for the
 * expected use cases.
