 * \brief Camera device handling
 *
 * At the core of libcamera is the camera device, combining one image source
 * with processing hardware able to provide one or multiple image streams. The
 * Camera class represents a camera device.
 *
 * A camera device contains a single image source, and separate camera device
 * instances relate to different image sources. For instance, a phone containing
 * front and back image sensors will be modelled with two camera devices, one
 * for each sensor. When multiple streams can be produced from the same image
 * source, all those streams are guaranteed to be part of the same camera
 * device.
 *
 * While not sharing image sources, separate camera devices can share other
 * system resources, such as an ISP. For this reason camera device instances may
 * not be fully independent, in which case usage restrictions may apply. For
 * instance, a phone with a front and a back camera device may not allow usage
 * of the two devices simultaneously.

/**
 * \class CameraConfiguration
 * \brief Hold configuration for streams of the camera

 * The CameraConfiguration holds an ordered list of stream configurations. It
 * supports iterators and operates as a vector of StreamConfiguration instances.
 * The stream configurations are inserted by addConfiguration(), and the
 * operator[](int) returns a reference to the StreamConfiguration based on its
 * insertion index. Accessing a stream configuration with an invalid index
 * results in undefined behaviour.
 *
 * CameraConfiguration instances are retrieved from the camera with
 * Camera::generateConfiguration(). Applications may then inspect the
 * configuration, modify it, and possibly add new stream configuration entries
 * with addConfiguration(). Once the camera configuration satisfies the
 * application, it shall be validated by a call to validate(). The validation
 * implements "try" semantics: it adjusts invalid configurations to the closest
 * achievable parameters instead of rejecting them completely. Applications
 * then decide whether to accept the modified configuration, or try again with
 * a different set of parameters. Once the configuration is valid, it is passed
 * to Camera::configure().

/**
 * \class Camera
 * \brief Camera device
 *
 * \todo Add documentation for camera start timings. What exactly does the
 * camera expect the pipeline handler to do when start() is called?
 *
 * The Camera class models a camera capable of producing one or more image
 * streams from a single image source. It provides the main interface to
 * configuring and controlling the device, and capturing image streams. It is
 * the central object exposed by libcamera.
 *
 * To support the central nature of Camera objects, libcamera manages the
 * lifetime of camera instances with std::shared_ptr<>. Instances shall be
 * created with the create() function which returns a shared pointer. The
 * Camera constructors and destructor are private, to prevent instances from
 * being constructed and destroyed manually.
 *
 * \section camera_operation Operating the Camera
 *
 * An application needs to perform a sequence of operations on a camera before
 * it is ready to process requests. The camera needs to be acquired and
 * configured to prepare the camera for capture. Once started the camera can
 * process requests until it is stopped. When an application is done with a
 * camera, the camera needs to be released.
 *
 * An application may start and stop a camera multiple times as long as it is
 * not released. The camera may also be reconfigured.
 *
 * Functions that affect the camera state as defined below are generally not
 * synchronized with each other by the Camera class. The caller is responsible
 * for ensuring their synchronization if necessary.
 *
 * \subsection Camera States
 *
 * To help manage the sequence of operations needed to control the camera a set
 * of states are defined. Each state describes which operations may be performed
 * on the camera. Performing an operation not allowed in the camera state
 * results in undefined behaviour. Operations not listed at all in the state
 * diagram are allowed in all states.
 *
 * \dot
 * digraph camera_state_machine {
 *   node [shape = doublecircle ]; Available;
 *   node [shape = circle ]; Acquired;
 *   node [shape = circle ]; Configured;
 *   node [shape = circle ]; Running;
 *
 *   Available -> Available [label = "release()"];
 *   Available -> Acquired [label = "acquire()"];
 *
 *   Acquired -> Available [label = "release()"];
 *   Acquired -> Configured [label = "configure()"];
 *
 *   Configured -> Available [label = "release()"];
 *   Configured -> Configured [label = "configure(), createRequest()"];
 *   Configured -> Running [label = "start()"];
 *
 *   Running -> Configured [label = "stop()"];
 *   Running -> Running [label = "createRequest(), queueRequest()"];
 * }
 * \enddot
 *
 * \subsubsection Available
 * The base state of a camera, an application can inspect the properties of the
 * camera to determine if it wishes to use it. If an application wishes to use
 * a camera it should acquire() it to proceed to the Acquired state.
 *
 * \subsubsection Acquired
 * In the acquired state an application has exclusive access to the camera and
 * may modify the camera's parameters to configure it and proceed to the
 * Configured state.
 *
 * \subsubsection Configured
 * The camera is configured and ready to be started. The application may
 * release() the camera and to get back to the Available state or start()
 * it to progress to the Running state.
 *
 * \subsubsection Running
 * The camera is running and ready to process requests queued by the
 * application. The camera remains in this state until it is stopped and moved
 * to the Configured state.
